boost-program-options
=====================

I really like using the boost http://boost.org program_options
library. I could not find a worked example in the source so decided to
create my own driven from tests. This is the result.

I also wrote a short article
http://www.grahambrooks.com/blog/boost-program_options/ explaining the
code.
